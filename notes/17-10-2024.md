# My Python Notes

```python
    print("Hello World!")
```

Now I learned something, we can clear Python interpreter screen by running this:

```
    >> import os
    >> os.system('clear')
```

The command above works on Linux or macOS. For Windows, just replace 'clear' with 'cls'

Why it works? Well ask chatGPT for that! haha
