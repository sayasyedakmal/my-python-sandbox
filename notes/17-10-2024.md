```python
    print("Hello World!")
```

Now I learned something, we can clear Python interpreter screen by running this:

```
    >> import os
    >> os.system('clear')
```

The command above works on Linux or macOS. For Windows, just replace 'clear' with 'cls'

Why it works? Well ask chatGPT for that! haha

We can also make the python file executable by using this code on the first line of the file:
#!/usr/bin/python3

Then, make it executable by using this command: chmod +x helloworld.py

Then, on terminal just type ./helloworld.py
It will execute and run whatever code in there. Try it!
