## Python Variables

- using id() method to see the memory address of a variable

### Basic variables

- string
- integer
- float

### Deleting variable reference

- using del() method - however, its not common to use this since Python use automatic garbage collection
- use del() when dealing with large dataset or managing resource

### OPTIONAL - use time command in debian linux to measure execution time of a script

- time command is built in command
- it will measure how long a command or script will runs
- for me, i just want to measure and compare if del method will make a different between 2 script - one using del, others does not
